# Music Generation

1. **Convert MP3 to MIDI**: 
   - MP3 files contain audio waveform data, which represents sound in a compressed format. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files, on the other hand, store musical notes and timing information rather than audio signals.
   - Converting MP3 to MIDI involves interpreting the audio data to identify notes, pitch, intensity, and timing. This is typically done using specialized software or libraries that can analyze the audio and produce a MIDI representation.

2. **Extract Notes from MIDI**: 
   - Once the MP3 is converted to MIDI, the MIDI file contains structured data about musical notes, such as pitch, duration, and timing.
   - Extraction involves parsing the MIDI file to retrieve this note data in a format that can be used for further processing.

3. **Train RNN Model on Notes Data**: 
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network suitable for sequential data, like sequences of musical notes.
   - Training an RNN involves feeding it sequences of notes extracted from MIDI files. The model learns patterns in the music, capturing relationships between notes and their temporal dependencies.
   - This training process allows the RNN to generate new sequences of notes that resemble the patterns observed in the training data.

4. **Generate New Notes with Trained RNN Model**: 
   - Once trained, the RNN model can generate new sequences of musical notes based on an initial set of seed notes or a starting condition.
   - The RNN uses its learned internal representations to predict the next notes in the sequence, iterating to generate longer sequences of music.

5. **Generate MIDI File from Generated Notes**: 
   - The final step involves converting the generated sequences of notes back into a MIDI format.
   - This conversion typically involves mapping the abstract representation of notes generated by the RNN (e.g., pitch, duration) into the structured format required by MIDI files.
   - The resulting MIDI file contains new musical compositions generated by the RNN model, which can be played back using MIDI-compatible software or devices.

This logical flow illustrates the process of leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically RNNs, to generate music from MP3 files through MIDI conversion and subsequent note generation. It combines signal processing (MP3 to MIDI conversion), machine learning (RNN training), and data transformation (MIDI generation) to enable creative applications in music composition and generation.
